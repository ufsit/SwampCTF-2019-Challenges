Data 1/15

Data

A newly imported program consi
sts of bytes that have not yet
 been identified. These bytes 
are known as undefined data an
d
are displayed using "??". Disa
ssembly, analysis, and other u
ser actions convert these byte
s into instructions or defined
data. In general, the term "da
ta" refers to defined data.

Data Types
Data is created by applying Da
ta Types to bytes in memory. D
ata Types interpret bytes as v
alues and provide a visual
interpretation of those bytes 
based on the Data Type used, e
.g., a four byte IEEE floating
 point number or a two byte
little endian word. Ghidra com
es packaged with a set of "Bui
lt-in" Data types (e.g., byte,
 word, float, etc). Ghidra
also provides the capability o
f creating "User-defined" Data
 types (structure, array, type
def, etc) and supports dynamic
data types whose structure dep
ends on the underlying data.
It is important to note that t
he size of many of the primiti
ve built-in types is determine
d by the language and
compiler specification (e.g., 
the size of an integer can var
y).

Applying Data Type
Data is created by applying a 
data type to undefined bytes i
n memory. There are numerous w
ays to apply data
types. A status message indica
ting whether or not data was c
reated is displayed in the too
l's status area.
Regardless of how a data type 
is applied, data is only creat
ed if the data type will fit w
ithin the available
undefined bytes.
Drag from Data Type Manager
Use the Data Type Manager to c
hoose a data type from the set
 of available data types. To a
pply a data type
from the data type Manager:
1.
2.
3.

Open the Data Type Manager (se
lect Window

Data Type Manager)

Select a data type from the Da
ta Type Manager
Drag the data type onto a sing
le address or selection in the
 Listing window

Cycle Groups
Cycle Groups are an easy way t
o apply basic data types (byte
, word, float, etc). A Cycle G
roup is a
collection of similar data typ
es that are commonly associate
d together. Cycling a data typ
e facilitates
changing from one data type to
 the next data type in the sam
e group. When the last data ty
pe is reached,
the cycle restarts.
Each Cycle Group has an associ
ated "hot key". Pressing the "
hot key" cycles from the curre
nt data type to
the next one within the group.
 Ghidra provides the following
 Cycle Groups:

To apply a data type from a cy
cle group:
1. Pick a basic data type to a
pply (for example double-word)
2.
3.

Place the cursor on the desire
d address or make a selection
Using the keyboard, press the 
associated "hot key" until the
 data type appears ("b" in thi
s case, 3
times) . In this example, the 
first time "b" is pressed, a b
yte (db) will appear in the mn
emonic
field. The second time a word 
(dw) will appear, and the last
 time a double-word (ddw) will
appear.

4. If you pressed the "hot key
" too many times and passed th
e data type, continue pressing
 the "hot
key" until you reach the data 
type again.

Favorites
A Favorite data type is a data
 type that you use frequently 
and want to apply from the Dat
a popup
menu. By default Ghidra sets m
ost commonly-used data types a
s Favorites. However, any data
 type can
be configured to be a favorite
.
To apply a favorite:
1. Right click on cursor locat
ion or selection
2. Select the Data popup subme
nu
3. In the Data popup, select t
he favorite data type to be ap
plied

To quickly assign a key bindin
g to a favorite, use the Key B
indings Shortcut. Key Bindings
 allow
you to assign "hot keys" to an
y menu item.
Recently Used Data Type
The last applied data type is 
always available at the bottom
 of the data menu. By default,
 the "hot key"
assigned to this option is 'Y'
. This feature is a useful sho
rtcut for applying the same da
ta type multiple
times.

Clearing Data
Data and instructions can be c
leared, reverting them back to
 their undefined state.
To clear defined data back to 
an undefined state:
1. Place the cursor on the def
ined data to be cleared
2. Press mouse-right, and choo
se Clear code bytes from the p
opup menu

Data 6/15
Deleting data types from the D
ata Type Manager window is a q
uick way to clear every instan
ce of a data type in
a program.

Changing Data Settings
Depending on the data type, da
ta may have settings available
 which affect the way it is di
splayed. For built-in datatype
s, the available settings are 
indicated in the table above. 
For example, the byte data typ
e has a format option which
allows the user to have the da
ta displayed as hex, octal, et
c. The available settings are 
defined in the Data Type Table
above. Data settings can be ch
anged for an individual data i
tem or for all data of the sam
e data type.
To change the settings of a si
ngle data item:
1. Place the cursor on the dat
a item
2. Press mouse-right to bring 
up the popup menu
3. Select Data
Settings... to bring up the se
ttings dialog

In the screenshot above, the s
ettings dialog is shown for a 
byte data type applied at addr
ess 0x01007192. The dialog
shows all the available settin
gs for that data type. For eac
h setting, the dialog shows th
e setting name, value, and a
checkbox indicating whether or
 not the setting matches the d
efault setting.
To change a setting, click on 
its value in the Setting colum
n. This will display a list of
 valid choices for that
setting. Choose a value from t
his list of choices and press 
OK. To reset a setting to its 
default value, set the Use
Default checkbox.
The default settings for a giv
en data type can be changed. W
hen a default setting has been
 changed, every data item
currently using the default se
tting for that data type will 
use the new default value. Dat
a items that have a modified
value for that setting will no
t be affected.
To change the default settings
 for a given data type:
1. Place the cursor on a data 
item of that type
2. Press mouse-right to bring 
up the popup menu
3. Select Data
Default Settings... to bring u
p the default settings dialog

Data 7/15

In the screenshot above, the d
efault setting dialog is shown
 for the word data type. The d
ialog shows all the available
settings for that data type. F
or each setting, the dialog sh
ows the setting name and value
.
To change a setting, click on 
its value in the Settings colu
mn. This will display a list o
f valid choices for that
setting. Choose a value from t
his list of choices and press 
OK.
Default settings on components
 within a structure apply to t
hat structure only. For exampl
e, if Struct_1 has a byte
component with its format set 
as Octal, then only other inst
ances of Struct_1 will be affe
cted. Settings on other
occurrences of byte are not af
fected.
A typedef has the same set of 
settings as its underlying dat
a type. For example, when you 
create a typedef on a
byte, the default settings on 
the typedef will be the same a
s the original default setting
s of the byte. Changing the
default settings for either th
e typedef or its underlying da
ta type doesn't affect the def
ault settings of the underlyin
g data
type or typedef respectively.
To change the data settings fo
r multiple data items:
1. Select data items of intere
st (does not work for interior
 array elements)
2. Press mouse-right to bring 
up the popup menu
3. Select Data
Settings... to bring up the se
ttings dialog

In the screenshot above, the c
ommon data settings dialog is 
shown for the current selectio
n. The dialog shows all the
settings common to all defined
 data within the current selec
tion. For each setting, the di
alog shows the setting name
and value, where the initial v
alue is blank. Settings left b
lank will not be affected, all
owing specific settings to be
changed without affecting othe
rs.

Creating Other Data Types

Structure
Ghidra provides two mechanisms
 to create and modify Structur
es. The Data Type Manager can 
be used to
create structures without appl
ying them immediately. It can 
also be used to edit them. Alt
ernatively,
structures can be created and 
modified directly in the brows
er.
This document describes how to
 directly create, edit and app
ly Structures in the browser.
Creating a new Structure
Creating a new structure in th
e browser uses previously defi
ned data to define the
structure. The structure is cr
eated and applied at the same 
time. To create a structure di
rectly
in the browser:
1.
2.
3.
4.

Select a set of contiguous def
ined or undefined Data
Use the right-mouse popup Data
Create Structure
The Data items within the sele
ction are used to define the s
tructure
The Create Structure dialog is
 displayed. This dialog can be
 used to either create a
new structure or apply an exis
ting structure that has a matc
hing format. If a new
structure is created, it will 
be added to the Data Type Mana
ger.

The Create Structure dialog is
 divided into two parts. In th
e top part is used to provide 
a
name if you are creating a new
 structure. It is initialized 
with a default name. The botto
m
part shows a list of matching 
structures. You can select fro
m this list to use that struct
ure
instead of creating a new one.
The method for finding matchin
g structures is either by an e
xact match or by a match on
structure size. You can change
 the type of matching used by 
clicking the Exact or Size rad
io

Data 8/15

The method for finding matchi
ng structures is either by an 
exact match or by a match on
structure size. You can change
 the type of matching used by 
clicking the Exact or Size rad
io
buttons under the Matching: he
ading.
To create a new structure, ent
er a unique name in the Create
 Structure By Name text field
and press OK.

To use an existing, matching s
tructure, find and select the 
structure in the Use Exising
Structure table and press OK.
You can create nested structur
es by following the instructio
ns above. The only
difference is in Step (1), sel
ect contiguous bytes within an
 existing structure.
Changing a Structure Name
1. Place the cursor on the fir
st line of the structure
2. Press mouse-right over the 
structure and choose Data
3. Change the name in the Stru
cture Editor

Edit Data Type...

Changing the name of a Structu
re member
There are two ways to rename a
 structure member. The first w
ay is useful for quickly
changing the name of a single 
member:
1. Right mouse click on the fi
eld name of a structure member
 in the Code Browser
2. Choose the Data
Rename Field option
3. Enter a new name in the Ren
ame Data Field dialog

The "Field Name" field must be
 added to the "Open Data" tab 
in the Code
Browser header in order for th
e data structure field names t
o show up in the Code

Data 9/15

The "Field Name" field must b
e added to the "Open Data" tab
 in the Code
Browser header in order for th
e data structure field names t
o show up in the Code
Browser.
The second way is more useful 
for changing the names of mult
iple members:
1. Place the cursor on the fir
st line of the structure
2. Press mouse-right over the 
structure and choose Data
3. Edit the field name for the
 structure member

Edit Data Type...

You cannot set the field name 
of undefined member

Union
Unlike structures, unions can 
only be created using the Unio
n Editor in the Data Type Mana
ger. Once a
union has been created, it can
 be applied like any other dat
a type.
Enum
An Enum (Enumeration) data typ
e is a C-style data type that 
allows the substitution of a v
alue for a more
meaningful name. Enums are cre
ated from the Data Type Manage
r using the Enum Editor. When 
you
apply the enum to a program, t
he name of the enum appears in
 the mnemonic field and the na
med value
corresponding to the byte at t
hat location appears in the op
erand field.
Example: Define an enum color 
with values red, green, and bl
ue assigned to 0x00, 0x01, 0x0
2
respectively. When you apply c
olor to:

010062abÂ Â Â  01Â Â Â  ??Â Â 
Â Â Â Â Â  01h

the result is:

010062abÂ Â Â  01Â Â Â  colorÂ
 Â Â Â  green

If the byte value is not one o
f the values defined in the en
um, "Unknown value: <value>" i
s displayed as
the operand.
Pointer
A pointer data type points to 
another data type, including o
ther pointers. Pointers can be
 typed or
untyped. Typed pointers specif
y the data type of the referre
d-to location. By default, poi
nters have the
same size as the size of an ad
dress for a particular process
or. For example, the pointers 
on a 32-bit
processor will be 4 bytes long
.
To apply an untyped pointer:
1.

Place the cursor over an undef
ined data

2.

Press the 'p' Quick-Key
- or -

2.

3.
4.

Press the 'p' Quick-Key
- or Drag a Pointer data type 
from the Data Type Manager win
dow

Data 11/15

A default-sized pointer is cre
ated
If a valid address can be form
ed at the location where you c
reated the pointer, a referenc
e is
created to that address.

To create a typed pointer:
1.
2.
3.

First create an untyped pointe
r (described above)
Apply a data type to the untyp
ed pointer
The mnemonic will change from 
'addr' to the referenced data 
type's mnemonic (ie: for a byt
e "db
*", for a pointer "addr *")

Pressing the 'p' key invokes t
he pointer action. This will g
enerally create a default poin
ter unless the
existing data is already a poi
nter in which case that pointe
r will be wrapped with an addi
tional pointer (e.
g., int * would become int **)
. This action will always appl
y a default sized pointer. Oth
erwise you can
drag one of the other pointer 
types from the Data Type Manag
er window. With existing point
er data, the
base type of that pointer may 
be changed simply by applying 
another type onto the pointer 
(e.g., applying
byte to default pointer become
s db *). If you do not want th
is pointer stacking behavior t
o happen, it is
best to clear the code unit(s)
 before applying a data type v
ia drag-n-drop or key-binding 
actions.
To create a pointer of a speci
fic size apply either pointer8
, pointer16, pointer32, or poi
nter64 to
create a pointer sizes of 1, 2
, 4, 8, respectively.
Array
An array is a collection of da
ta items of a single data type
. The number of elements in th
e array is specified
when the array is created. Arr
ays can also be multi-dimensio
nal. In this case, the innermo
st dimension is
created first.
To create an array,
1. Place the cursor at the add
ress where you want to create 
an array
2. Create one data item of the
 base data type for the array.
 Any data type is valid, inclu
ding structures
3. Press the '[' Quick-Key,
- or Press mouse-right on the 
data item and choose Data
Create Array
4. A dialog will prompt you fo
r the number of elements in th
e array. It will be initialize
d with the
maximum number of elements tha
t will fit into the available 
undefined bytes. It will also 
let you
know the largest array you can
 make if you allow it to clear
 existing data.
5. Enter the number of element
s in the array, and press OK
To create a multi-dimensional 
array:
1. Create an array using the i
nner dimension for the number 
of elements
2. Place the cursor over the n
ew array
3. Press the '[' Quick-Key,
- or Press mouse-right on the 
array and choose Data
Create Array
4. Enter the number of element
s for the next dimension, and 
press OK
5. Repeat steps (3) and (4) un
til all dimensions have been c
reated

Typedef

Data 12/15

A typedef is an alias for anot
her data type. It is useful fo
r giving a more meaningful nam
e to a data
type. For example, you might t
ypedef dword to be int. Typede
fs are created using the Data 
Type Manager
and applied like any other dat
a type.
Void
A void data type can only be u
sed as the return type (i.e., 
<RETURN> variable) of a functi
on and can be
specified from the Function Ed
itor, Set Data Type popup acti
on menu, as well as from the D
ata Type
Manager using drag-and-drop.
String Data Types
A String consists of a sequenc
e of characters and is general
ly terminated by a null charac
ter ('\0') or has a
length value prefixed before t
he string.
Characters in a string
The characters that make up a 
string can be encoded from byt
es in a multitude of ways:
Single bytes from the ASCII or
 other character set.
16 bit or 32 bit int values fr
om the respective Unicode char
acter sets.
Variable length byte/int seque
nces that encode a single char
acter, such as UTF-8 or UTF16.
Size of a string
The extent of the string is de
termined by:
Null terminating character ('\
0').
Containing field length (ie. f
ixed length strings, or length
 of an array of characters).
Prefixed length value for Pasc
al strings.
Each Ghidra string data type w
ill document if its null-termi
nated or fixed length or pasca
l in
its description or its type na
me.
The difference between null-te
rminated and fixed length stri
ngs is subtle. A null- termina
ted
string will extend until a nul
l character is found (with a s
anity check max of 16k), regar
dless
of the size of the field/struc
ture that contains the string,
 whereas a fixed length string
's length
is determined by its containin
g field, with trailing null ch
aracters trimmed, but interior
 null
characters preserved.
In practice, the user will be 
unable to create a null-termin
ated string in Ghidra that exc
eeds its
containing field/structure as 
the UI will size the containin
g field to match the detected 
length
of the null-terminated string.
 However, if the bytes that ma
ke up the contents of the null
terminated string are changed,
 and the null-terminating char
acters are overwritten, the st
ring
instance could use bytes from 
outside of its footprint to co
nstruct itself. In this case t
he string
will be displayed in red to in
dicate that there is an issue.
Character sets
Character sets define how char
acters are represented as byte
 values, and how byte values a
re
converted into characters.

Not all byte values are valid
 character encodings, and may 
result in undecode-able values
 - for
example, byte values from 128.
.255 are not valid when using 
a US-ASCII character set, but
are valid when using IBM437.
When a invalid mapping is enco
untered, it will be represente
d as the Unicode character 'â€
«' Ú¡â€¬,
which will render on your scre
en with an OS and font specifi
c shape (it is called the
"REPLACEMENT CHARACTER" and is
 typically encoded as [\uFFFD]
).
The following character sets a
re always available:
US-ASCII
limited to values between 0-12
7.
ISO-8859-1 (Latin 1)
see also windows-1252.
UTF-8
variable length 1-3 byte Unico
de encoding.
only Unicode values greater th
an 007F cause multi-byte seque
nces, otherwise
indistinguishable from US-ASCI
I.
UTF-16, UTF-16BE, UTF-16LE
2 byte Unicode encoding.
variable length, 2 or 4 bytes
UTF-32, UTF-32BE, UTF-32LE
4 byte Unicode encoding.

Other character sets that are 
typically implemented in the J
ava JVM:
IBM437
old school extended ASCII.
Windows-1252
GB2312
Chinese
variable length 1-2 bytes
Many many more...
Unicode Byte Order Marks (BOM)
Unicode strings can start with
 a special character that sign
als the endian-ness of the
string. The BOM character byte
s will be FE FF (16 bit) or 00
 00 FE FF (32 bit) if
the string is big endian, othe
rwise it will be FF FE (16 bit
) or FF FE 00 00 (32
bit) if the string is little e
ndian.
If the BOM is present, it will
 override the endian-ness of t
he binary that contains
the string.
Arrays of character elements
Arrays of character elements (
ie. char[16]) are treated as f
ixed-length string data types.
Arrays of wide char data types
 (wchar, wchar16, wchar32) are
 treated as Unicode strings.
Creating string instances

Data 13/15

Creating string instances

Data 14/15

When creating a String at a lo
cation, consecutive characters
 will be included in the Strin
g until
a null character ('\0') is enc
ountered.
When applied to a selection, S
tring data types absorb all by
tes in the selection into a si
ngle
string ignoring terminators.
TerminatedCStrings, on the oth
er hand, create multiple strin
gs for the selected bytes,
beginning a new string at each
 terminator.
Settings for string instances
Each string instance has setti

change the way the string is d
ecoded
and how it is rendered when di
splayed.

Dynamic Data Type
Dynamic data types adapt to th
e underlying bytes to which th
ey are applied. These data typ
es can only be
created by writing a new Java 
class. For example, an IP head
er packet that has a header, b
ody, and
terminator might be a good can
didate for writing a Dynamic d
ata type. The header might spe
cify the length
of the body. The Dynamic data 
type can change its size and s
tructure based on the informat
ion stored in the
IP header.
The PE (Windows Portable Execu
table) data type is another ex
ample of a dynamic data type t
hat
manufactures new data types. W
hen you apply the PE data type
, it creates (1) a new categor
y (using the
address as the name) in the pr
ogram data type manager, (2) a
 structure for the DOS header,
 and (3) a
structure, PE, that contains t
he DOS header. In order for th
e PE data type to be successfu
lly applied, you
must import a DOS program as b
inary file.. The size of the s
tructure varies according to t
he information in
the program.
